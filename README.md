## About
This repository hosts the implementation of our research paper, "Optimizing Option Pricing and Implied Volatility with Advanced Neural Networks," authored by You Xiang Chen, Tin Yu Lu, and Yu Jan Song from the National Tsing Hua University. Our work builds on the seminal efforts of Liu, Oosterlee, and Bohte by integrating advanced methodologies like Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and node pruning for model compression, achieving a 10% improvement in accuracy and a 50% enhancement in computational speed for predicting option prices and implied volatilities.

The substantial increase in computational speed achieved through advanced neural network optimization has significant implications across various domains of finance, especially in High-Frequency Trading (HFT), where decision-making processes are critically time-sensitive. This section explores how the improvements documented in "Optimizing Option Pricing and Implied Volatility with Advanced Neural Networks" can be leveraged in HFT and similar scenarios, enhancing operational efficiency and strategic effectiveness.

### Implications for High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

#### Enhanced Decision-Making Speed
In HFT, where algorithms execute a large number of orders at high speeds, the ability to compute option pricing and implied volatilities 50% faster can provide a competitive edge. Faster computations allow HFT algorithms to adjust their positions and strategies more rapidly in response to market changes, maximizing profit opportunities and minimizing losses during volatile periods.

#### Improved Risk Management
The accuracy and speed of implied volatility calculations are crucial for risk assessment and management in trading strategies. By enabling quicker adjustments to portfolios based on accurate, real-time volatility estimates, traders can better hedge their positions and manage risk, even in fast-moving markets.

#### Increased Throughput
With enhanced computational efficiency, trading systems can process a greater volume of transactions within the same time frame. This increased throughput allows for the exploitation of more trading opportunities, a core objective in HFT where profit margins can be slim and dependent on volume.

#### Real-Time Analytics
The advancements in neural network optimizations facilitate real-time analytics, enabling traders to analyze and respond to market indicators and news instantly. This capability is particularly valuable in algorithmic trading, where strategies often rely on the timely interpretation of market data to make informed decisions.

#### Scalability
Improved computational speed and model efficiency directly contribute to the scalability of financial models and trading algorithms. Firms can scale their operations more effectively, managing larger datasets and more complex models without proportionate increases in computational resources or latency.
