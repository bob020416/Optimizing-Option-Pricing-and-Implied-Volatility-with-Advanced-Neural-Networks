# Optimizing-Option-Pricing-and-Implied-Volatility-with-Advanced-Neural-Networks

Creating a GitHub repository for your paper, "Optimizing Option Pricing and Implied Volatility with Advanced Neural Networks," and accompanying code (ann_iv.ipynb for optimizing IV, ann_opt.ipynb for optimization with ANN, and Model_Building-1.ipynb for the overall model building) involves several steps. These steps include drafting a README that concisely introduces the project, describes its significance, and guides users on how to use the provided notebooks. Here's a structured approach to setting up your repository and crafting the necessary documentation:

### GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Repository Name:** `Optimizing_Option_Pricing_with_ANN`
